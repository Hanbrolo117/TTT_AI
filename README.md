# T^3_AI
##Description
This is a Java implementation of a Player Class with an AI that can play a game of 3x3 Tic Tac Toe. This code source also comes with a test case.
This Player cannot defeat itself, it can only ever Draw. Thus far I have yet to defeat it myself, I have only ever Drawn with it. Feel free 
to use this codebase to implement your own Java Tic Tac Toe game and throw a UI on it or what have you. Fellow TTTing!
